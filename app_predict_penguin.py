It is the most widespread penguin species, and,along with the emperor penguin, is the most southerly distributed of all penguins. It is named after Adélie Land, in turn, named for Adèle Dumont d'Urville, who was married to French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who first discovered this penguin in 1840. Adélie penguins obtain their food by both predation and foraging, with a diet of mainly krill and fish.")

Its name stems from the narrow black band under its head, which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify.[2] Other common names include ringed penguin, bearded penguin, and stonecracker penguin, due to its loud, harsh call.")

The earliest scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster with a type locality in the Falkland Islands. The species calls in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting, which the bird emits with its head thrown back.")
